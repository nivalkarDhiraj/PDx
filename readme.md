# API Development

The API has been developed using .Net core 3.1 framework.

The service has three endpoints. The auth endpoint can be used to generate token, patient for patient CRUD operation and lab report for lab report CRUD operation.

## Overview

To use this API, please close the code from repository, build it and run on local.

The JWT basic authentication has been implemented to and needs to generate token with valid credential and pass this token as bearer token, to use any API endpoints. The API auth endpoint can be used to generate token by passing credential details as Basic-Auth or using authorization header.

The in-memory cache has been implemented to support all CURD operation, and all data will be loosed once the API is stopped.

## Solution file

The solution file is placed inside folder (HCA.PlatformDigital) which can be used to open/explore all projects.


## Documentation


The swagger has been implemented for API documentation purpose. The swagger endpoint is the default endpoint ({baseurl}/pd/swagger) on local when executed. The swagger main page can be used to refer the sample payload for endpoints. 

Please follow below steps to test the service: 

### Auth


baseurl/auth: Please use this endpoint to generate token by providing valid credential as basic-auth. Please refer appsettings.json file having section identityconfiguration and key (email, accesskey) as credential.

### Patient


{baseurl}/patient/create: This endpoint can be used to create patient with below payload.

{
  "patientId": "",
  "name": "James John",
  "dob": "1972-10-15",
  "isMale": true,
  "contactNo": ""
}

Patient name and DOB are required field, patient id will be autogenerated. 

{baseurl}/patient/update: This endpoint can be used to update patient details and below sample payload can be for this.

{
  "patientId": "",
  "name": "James John",
  "dob": "1972-10-15",
  "isMale": true,
  "contactNo": ""
}

The patient id, name and DOB are required field. The patient already created can be updated only based on auto-generated patient id. 


{baseurl}/patient/delete: This endpoint can be used to delete patient already created. Please refer below endpoint and parameter to delete patient.

/delete/{patientId}

A valid patient id needs to be passed as route parameter to delete patient. You can verify patient is deleted or not can refer patient list endpoint. 

{baseurl}/patient/get: This endpoint can be used to get list of patients. 


{baseurl}/patient/get/{patientid}: This endpoint can be used to get specific patient details by patient id. 

{baseurl}/patient/filter/{testname}/{startDate}/{endDate}: This endpoint can be used to filter patients list who have conducted specific test and with test date range. 

The test name is mandatory parameter for this endpoint and date range (sate date and end date) is optional.

### LabReport


{baseurl}/labreport/create: This endpoint can be used to create lab report for a patient and patient should exists in the system. The below payload can be used to create lab report.
